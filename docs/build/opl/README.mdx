# Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL)

The Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) is a powerful solution that enables developers
to integrate privacy features into their decentralized applications (dApps)
across multiple EVM-compatible networks.

- **Privacy-First**: OPL leverages the [Sapphire]'s privacy features to ensure
that contract data and computation remains confidential.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: OPL is compatible with multiple blockchains
through message bridging protocols, making it easy to integrate privacy
regardless of the chain your dApp is built on.

For more information about OPL and to catch the latest news, please visit the
[official OPL page].

## How OPL Works

The OPL is made possible through message bridges, which enable secure
communication between OPL-enabled contracts on Sapphire and smart contracts on
other chains. This allows dApps to access privacy-preserving capabilities while
keeping their main logic on their primary chain.

## Message Bridges

You can integrate message bridges into your dApps using one of these three
methods:

- **[OPL SDK]**: A wrapper provided by the Oasis Protocol that simplifies the
integration of message bridging with Oasisâ€™s privacy features.
- **[Celer Inter-Chain Messaging (IM)][celer]**: A generalized message bridging solution
by Celer, which lets you build more complex solutions.
- **[Router Protocol CrossTalk][router]**: An extensible cross-chain framework that
enables seamless state transitions across multiple chains.
- **[Hyperlane Protocol][hyperlane]**: A permissionless interoperability protocol
that enables seamless cross-chain communication for developers.
