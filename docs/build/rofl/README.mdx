# Build ROFL App

Runtime OFf-chain Logic (ROFL) apps are a mechanism to augment the deterministic
on-chain backend with verifiable off-chain applications. These applications are
stateless, have access to the network and can perform expensive and/or
non-deterministic computation.

ROFL apps run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), similar to the on-chain
confidential runtimes. This enables them to securely authenticate to the
on-chain backend which is handled transparently by the framework. Together they
allow one to implement secure decentralized oracles, bridges, AI agents and
more.

This chapter will teach you how to build your own ROFL app with the help of the
[Oasis Runtime SDK].
