    <>
      Contains learning material for the smart contract developers. Since the
      Oasis platform is best known for confidentiality, the most notable
      ParaTime is <a href="/build/sapphire/">Oasis Sapphire</a>, an{" "}
      EVM-compatible ParaTime with built-in contract state encryption. The Oasis
      team also prepared a set of libraries called the{" "}
      <a href="/build/opl/">Oasis Privacy Layer</a> to bridge existing dApps
      running on other chains and use the unique Sapphire's confidentiality.
      <br />
      <br />
      Our <a href="/build/rofl/">Runtime Offchain Logic (ROFL)</a> enables you to{" "}
      build secure applications running offchain in a trusted environment (TEE) that
      seamlessly communicate with Oasis Sapphire. This is ideal for trusted oracles,
      compute-expensive tasks in AI, or as a backend for interactive games.
