    Our [Runtime Offchain Logic (ROFL)](/build/rofl/) enables you to build
    secure applications running in a trusted environment (TEE). This is ideal
    for trusted oracles, AI agents, verifiable compute tasks such as AI
    training, or game servers.

    ROFL can seamlessly communicate with [Oasis Sapphire](/build/sapphire/)â€”an
    EVM-compatible L1 blockchain with built-in contract state and end-to-end
    transaction encryption.

    The Oasis team also prepared a set of libraries called the
    [Oasis Privacy Layer](/build/opl/) to bridge existing dApps running
    on other chains with the unique Sapphire's confidentiality and other
    [tools](/build/tools/).

  This introductory part contains general overview of the Oasis Network such as
  the distinction between the consensus layer and different ParaTimes. It
  also covers wallets and other tools for managing your assets across the Oasis
  chains and how to use unique Oasis features.

  If you want to run your own Oasis node, this part will provide you with guides on the current Mainnet and Testnet network parameters and how to set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps running a ParaTime or just a simple client node for your server to submit transactions and perform queries on the network.

  Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis Network or just learn more about the Oasis consensus layer and other core components, this is the part for you.

  Additions or changes to the interoperable Oasis network components are always made with consensus. Similar to the Ethereum's ERC/EIP mechanism Oasis follows formal Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) which are first proposed, voted on and finally implemented, if accepted.
