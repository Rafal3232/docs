  This introductory part contains general overview of the Oasis Network such as
  the distinction between the consensus layer and different ParaTimes. It
  also covers wallets and other tools for managing your assets across the Oasis
  chains and how to use unique Oasis features.

  Contains learning material for the smart contract developers. Since the
  Oasis platform is best known for confidentiality, the most notable
  ParaTime is [Oasis Sapphire](/build/sapphire/), an
  EVM-compatible ParaTime with built-in contract state encryption. The Oasis
  team also prepared a set of libraries called the
  [Oasis Privacy Layer](/build/opl/) to bridge existing dApps running
  on other chains and use the unique Sapphire's confidentiality.

  Our [Runtime Offchain Logic (ROFL)](/build/rofl/) enables you
  to build secure applications running offchain in a trusted environment
  (TEE) that seamlessly communicate with Oasis Sapphire. This is ideal for
  trusted oracles, compute-expensive tasks in AI, or as a backend for
  interactive games.

  If you want to run your own Oasis node, this part will provide you with guides on the current Mainnet and Testnet network parameters and how to set up your node, let it be a validator node, perhaps running a ParaTime or just a simple client node for your server to submit transactions and perform queries on the network.

  Whether you want to contribute your code to the core components of the Oasis Network or just learn more about the Oasis consensus layer and other core components, this is the part for you.

  Additions or changes to the interoperable Oasis network components are always made with consensus. Similar to the Ethereum's ERC/EIP mechanism Oasis follows formal Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) which are first proposed, voted on and finally implemented, if accepted.
